_Simple, one-click trade barking._

## Using Woof

Getting started with _Woof_ couldn't be simpler. Drop the whole shebang into `Interface\AddOns`, then enable it in your AddOns menu. Once in game, type `\wf` to show the _Woof_ panel.

To bark an item in trade, drop any item onto the item slot, then set its price and custom message. Click __Test__ to preview and revise your message, then use __Bark__ to spam trade chat. Once you hear the "Woof!", your bark is complete.
