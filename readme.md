## Getting Started

Getting started with _Woof_ couldn't be simpler. Drop the whole shebang into `Interface\AddOns`, then enable it in your AddOns menu. Once in game, type `/wf` to show the _Woof_ panel.

To bark an item in trade, drop any item onto the item slot, then set its price and custom message. Click __Test__ to preview and revise your message, then use __Bark__ to spam trade chat. Once you hear the "Woof!", your bark is complete.

## Features

### Item Memory

_Woof_ will automatically remember any item that has been barked, so if you sell multiple items, you don't have to worry about pricing and describing _every single time_. Forget dozens of annoying macros, _Woof_ handles them for you.

### Simple Slash Commands

To display _Woof_, just type `/wf` (or `/woof`). To hide _Woof_, type `/wf close`.

If dragging and dropping is too tough for you, you can open _Woof_ with an item by typing `/wf <item link>`.
